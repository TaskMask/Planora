# Personal Account Data Contamination Fix

## Problem Statement
Personal accounts were loading demo data instead of starting with an empty, clean state. When users clicked on personal account options (Google, Email, Register), they would see demo boards and data instead of their own empty personal workspace.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Automatic Sample Data Loading for Personal Accounts**
**File**: `src/pages/BoardsPage.tsx`
**Issue**: The BoardsPage was calling `loadSampleDataToStorage()` and `loadSampleDataToRedux()` for ALL non-demo users, which meant personal accounts automatically received sample data on first login.

### 2. **Global Storage Migration Contamination**
**File**: `src/features/boards/boardsSlice.ts`
**Issue**: The `fetchBoards` function was migrating ANY data from global storage that matched the userId, including demo data that might have been stored in global keys.

### 3. **Lists Data Migration Issues**
**File**: `src/features/lists/listsSlice.ts`
**Issue**: The lists fetching was migrating ALL global lists regardless of ownership, causing demo lists to appear in personal accounts.

### 4. **Insufficient Data Cleanup**
**File**: `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`
**Issue**: Personal account login handlers weren't clearing global storage keys that might contain demo data.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Removed Automatic Sample Data for Personal Accounts**
**File**: `src/pages/BoardsPage.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
} else {
  // Load sample data if no existing data for regular users
  loadSampleDataToStorage(user.id);
  loadSampleDataToRedux(user.id, dispatch);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
} else {
  // For personal accounts, just fetch existing data (no sample data loading)
  console.log('Personal account detected - fetching existing user data only');
}
```

**Result**: Personal accounts now start completely empty unless they have existing data.

### 2. **Enhanced Board Data Migration Logic**
**File**: `src/features/boards/boardsSlice.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
// If no user-specific boards, try to migrate from global storage
if (userBoards.length === 0) {
  const storedBoards = loadBoardsFromStorage();
  userBoards = storedBoards.filter(board => board.ownerId === userId);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// If no user-specific boards and this is NOT a demo user, try to migrate from global storage
if (userBoards.length === 0 && userId !== 'demo-user-123') {
  const storedBoards = loadBoardsFromStorage();
  // Only migrate boards that belong to this specific user (not demo data)
  userBoards = storedBoards.filter(board => 
    board.ownerId === userId && board.ownerId !== 'demo-user-123'
  );
}
```

**Result**: Demo data is explicitly excluded from personal account migration.

### 3. **Fixed Lists Data Migration**
**File**: `src/features/lists/listsSlice.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
// If no user-specific lists, try to migrate from global storage
if (allLists.length === 0) {
  const globalLists = loadListsFromStorage();
  allLists = globalLists; // This migrated ALL lists
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// If no user-specific lists and this is NOT a demo user, ensure clean slate
if (allLists.length === 0 && userId !== 'demo-user-123') {
  // For personal accounts, don't migrate any lists from global storage
  // to ensure they start with a clean slate
  allLists = [];
}
```

**Result**: Personal accounts don't inherit any lists from global storage.

### 4. **Enhanced Authentication Data Cleanup**
**File**: `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`

**Enhanced all personal account handlers** (`handlePersonalLogin`, `handleGoogleLogin`, `handleRegister`):

**Added**:
```typescript
// Clear any existing demo data and global storage that might interfere
localStorage.removeItem('planora_demo_user');
localStorage.removeItem('planora_boards_demo-user-123');
localStorage.removeItem('planora_lists_demo-user-123');
localStorage.removeItem('planora_cards_demo-user-123');
// Also clear global storage to prevent contamination
localStorage.removeItem('planora_boards');
localStorage.removeItem('planora_lists');
localStorage.removeItem('planora_cards');
```

**Result**: Personal account login now completely cleans any existing demo or global data.

## Data Flow After Fix

### Demo Account Flow:
1. Click "Try Demo" → Clear demo-specific storage → Load fresh sample data → Navigate to `/demo`
2. Demo data stored with keys: `planora_boards_demo-user-123`, etc.
3. Demo always starts fresh with sample boards, lists, and cards

### Personal Account Flow:
1. Click personal account option → Clear ALL existing data (demo + global)
2. Authenticate via Firebase → Navigate to `/boards`
3. Personal data stored with keys: `planora_boards_{actual-user-id}`, etc.
4. **Personal accounts start completely empty**
5. Users create their own boards, lists, and cards from scratch
6. Personal data persists across sessions

## Storage Key Structure

### Demo Storage:
- `planora_demo_user` - Demo user info
- `planora_boards_demo-user-123` - Demo boards
- `planora_lists_demo-user-123` - Demo lists  
- `planora_cards_demo-user-123` - Demo cards

### Personal Storage:
- `planora_boards_{firebase-user-id}` - Personal boards
- `planora_lists_{firebase-user-id}` - Personal lists
- `planora_cards_{firebase-user-id}` - Personal cards

### Global Storage (Legacy):
- `planora_boards`, `planora_lists`, `planora_cards` - Now cleared on personal login

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ **Personal Account First Time**:
1. New user clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Should see empty boards page with "Create your first board" message
3. No demo data should be visible

### ✅ **Personal Account Returning**:
1. Existing user logs in
2. Should see their previously created boards
3. No demo data contamination

### ✅ **Demo to Personal Switch**:
1. Use demo → Switch to personal account
2. Personal account should be empty
3. Demo data should not appear in personal account

### ✅ **Personal to Demo Switch**:
1. Use personal account → Switch to demo
2. Demo should show fresh sample data
3. Personal data should not appear in demo

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/BoardsPage.tsx` - Removed automatic sample data loading
- `src/features/boards/boardsSlice.ts` - Enhanced migration logic
- `src/features/lists/listsSlice.ts` - Fixed lists migration
- `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx` - Enhanced data cleanup on login

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- Personal accounts now start completely empty
- No demo data contamination
- Clean separation between demo and personal data
- Proper data persistence for personal accounts
- Fresh demo experience every time
