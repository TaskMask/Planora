# Demo Connection Fix - Authentication Race Condition

## Problem
The demo components were redirecting back to the login page when navigating between them, despite having proper routing set up.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **race condition** in the authentication initialization:

1. Demo pages were calling `loginDemo()` on every mount
2. The child components (`BoardsPage`, `AnalyticsPage`, etc.) were using `useAuth()` 
3. `useAuth()` was checking authentication state before the demo login completed
4. This caused the authentication check to fail temporarily, triggering redirects to login

## Solution
Updated all demo pages to properly handle authentication state:

### Before (Race Condition)
```tsx
export const DemoPage: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeDemo = async () => {
      // Always login demo user (even if already logged in)
      const demoUser = await dispatch(loginDemo()).unwrap();
      // Load sample data
      resetSampleData(demoUser.id, dispatch);
    };
    initializeDemo();
  }, [dispatch]);

  return <BoardsPage />; // Renders immediately, before auth completes
};
```

### After (Proper State Management)
```tsx
export const DemoPage: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeDemo = async () => {
      // Check if demo user is already logged in
      if (user?.id === 'demo-user-123') {
        setIsInitializing(false);
        return;
      }
      
      // Only login if not already authenticated
      const demoUser = await dispatch(loginDemo()).unwrap();
      resetSampleData(demoUser.id, dispatch);
      setIsInitializing(false);
    };
    initializeDemo();
  }, [dispatch, user]);

  // Show loading state while initializing
  if (isInitializing) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  return <BoardsPage />; // Only renders after auth is complete
};
```

## Fixed Components
- ✅ `DemoPage.tsx` - Demo boards overview
- ✅ `DemoAnalyticsPage.tsx` - Demo analytics dashboard  
- ✅ `DemoBoardDetailPage.tsx` - Individual demo board details

## Navigation Flow Now Works
1. **Demo Overview** (`/demo`) → Initialize demo auth → Show boards
2. **Click Board** → Navigate to `/demo/boards/sample-board-1` → Show board details with cards
3. **Click Analytics** → Navigate to `/demo/analytics` → Show analytics dashboard
4. **Navigate Back** → Seamless navigation between all demo components

## Result
✅ **No more login page redirects**
✅ **Smooth navigation between demo components**
✅ **Proper authentication state management**
✅ **Cards display correctly in board views**
✅ **Analytics show accurate data**
✅ **Complete demo portfolio experience**

The demo now provides a fully functional project management showcase with:
- 3 professional project boards
- 11 total cards across different stages
- Analytics dashboard with real metrics
- Seamless navigation throughout the demo experience
