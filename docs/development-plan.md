## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- **Backend**: Firebase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit for accessible drag-and-drop functionality

### Data Model
```
users/{userId}
  - email, displayName, photoURL, createdAt, updatedAt

boards/{boardId}
  - title, description, ownerId, members[], createdAt, updatedAt
  - subcollections: lists, activities

boards/{boardId}/lists/{listId}
  - title, position, createdAt, updatedAt
  
boards/{boardId}/lists/{listId}/cards/{cardId}
  - title, description, position, labels[], assignees[], dueDate
  - createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt
  - subcollections: comments, attachments
```

### Security
- Firestore security rules based on board membership
- User can only access boards they are members of
- File uploads restricted by size and type
- Client-side and server-side validation

## Next Steps

1. Set up Firebase project and configure environment variables
2. Implement basic authentication flow
3. Create reusable UI components
4. Build board and list management features
5. Add drag-and-drop functionality
